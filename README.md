Justice League - Task Force


About


Darkseid has controlled everyone's mind and turned the Justice League against each other.  You have to choose your character and survive.
Select your character and then select your enemy.  When ready, press the "attack" button in the middle of the screen.  It will decribe what damage was given.
When there are no opponents left, that means you have survived!


This was meant to be a nastalgic type game remembering Justice League Task Force on Sega Genesis.
Please do not play it on a mobile device since it is not responsive.
